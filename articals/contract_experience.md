# Contracting Experience
I have operated in companies with entirely different products and applications. Each case presented a new challenge for which I successfully provided a solution and, at the same time, reduced costs and increased profitability.

Here are some examples:

## WI-FI AND BLUE TOOTH TESTING
The client gave an extremely tight deadline to achieve their targets and meet the schedule of test certification. Previously, more than 150k data points from their tests results were manually organised and processed; Taking an unreasonable period and unnecessarily occupying the time of the technical
personnel.

The conclusion was a concept created to not only automate data collection but also process the result and present these in a report which would also clearly show anomalies, errors, missing data and data statistics; The data report is available in less than a minute, equally, any revisions or updates are concluded almost instantly – saving months of engineering time for the client’s core technology.

### Other Key Developments
The automated data collection method also showed there were discrepancies due to the testing facilities and, as an example, I introduced a Wi-Fi test which demonstrated the deficiencies of the RF loss due to wiring.



## RF PERFORMANCE FOR MAGNETIC INDUCTION COMMUNICATION
A new revision of this client’s chip design was being tested before entering production. Following restructuring within the organisation it became necessary to change the testing and implement new testing procedures.
The original tests were limited in documentation and had no clear instructions of how the scripts should run. This wasn’t compatible with the development of the product. By reverse engineering the tests it was revealed that latest chip revision performed worse than the
predecessor. After implementing further testing to investigate relevant tuning parameters I was able to discover values that optimised the performance above the previous design. These new values are now used by the client as the default settings for their production.



## DVB DEMODULATION PERFORMANCE OF IP PLATFORM
In this case, the Algorithm Design Engineers were improving the performance of DVB demodulation on their product platform in order to outperform the competition. They were in need of additional testing capabilities for the new standard and to significantly reduce the duration of the tests. I implemented the test for the DVB-S2X standard, modernised the test search algorithms and control methods with a surprising threefold increase in productivity.
Additionally, I was able to carry out test procedures in parallel by calibrating broadcasting equipment and also increasing testing output, which effectively saved investments which would otherwise have proved impossible to provide.
