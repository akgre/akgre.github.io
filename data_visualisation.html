        <h1 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h1>
        <p>It's no secret that data can be very powerful — when you can actually understand what it's telling you, that is.</p>
        <p>It's not easy to get clear takeaways by looking at a slew of numbers and stats. You need to have the data presented in a logical, easy-to-understand way so you can apply your learnings in an effective way.</p>
        <p>The human brain processes visual information better than it processes text — so using charts, graphs, and design elements, data visualization can help you explain trends and stats much more easily. But, not all data visualization is created equal.</p>
        <h2 id="data-visualization-best-practices">Data Visualization Best Practices</h2>
        <p>While determining how you'll visualize your data, one of the first things you'll want to do is keep the following best practices in mind.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Choose the best visual for your data and it's purpose.</li>
        <li>Ensure your data is easily understandable and viewable.</li>
        <li>Offer necessary context for your audience in and around your visual.</li>
        <li>Keep your visual as simple and straightforward as possible.</li>
        <li>Educate your audience with your visual.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="identify-trends-and-outliers">Identify Trends And Outliers</h2>
        <p>If you were to sift through raw data manually, it could take ages to notice patterns, trends or outlying data. But by using data visualization tools like charts, you can sort through a lot of data quickly.</p>
        <p>Even better, charts enable you to pick up on trends a lot quicker than you would sifting through numbers.</p>
        <h2 id="the-discovery-process">The Discovery Process</h2>
        <p>When discovering your data you don't want your tools slowing you down. This is where I like to use data visualisation software.</p>
        <p>It is best software for creating visual dashboards. Most reporting tools require your analyst to know exactly what they’re trying to build before they begin, making initial data exploration a slow process of trial and error.</p>
        <p>Tableau’s drag and drop interface allows for anyone to quickly try new ideas, drill into interesting areas and make updates. The ability to rapidly explore and build out visualizations allows for dashboards to provide the most useful and relevant information.</p>
        <h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
        <p>Once the data of interest has been set they can introduced to the report document.</p>
        <p>Tests produce a lot of data that often must be presented to a team so that knowledgeable data driven decisions can be made and fed into the product development lifecycle. To drive consensus among your group, the best way to present data is through reports. Reports can highlight anomalies and help you dig into the details of why a change didn’t perform as expected. Reports can also verify that a change did impact a product positively, such as a performance improvement over the last iteration of a product.</p>
