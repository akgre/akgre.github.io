                <p>It's no secret that data can be very powerful — when you can actually understand what it's telling
                    you,
                    that is.</p>
                <p>It's not easy to get clear takeaways by looking at a slew of numbers and stats. You need to have the
                    data
                    presented in a logical, easy-to-understand way so you can apply your learnings in an effective way.
                    Using charts, graphs, and design elements, data visualization can help you explain trends and stats
                    much
                    more easily. But, not all data visualization is created equal.</p>
                <h2 id="real-life-example">Real-Life Example</h2>
                <p>I have created a hypothetical example of a chart that was used in a report.</p>
                <p>We are testing three units of the same product that has Wi-Fi and each has 2 outputs. We want to know
                    the
                    transmit power vs channel number of each of the outputs, if they are within set limits and the
                    differences between the output and the individual units.</p>
                <p><img src="https://github.com/akgre/akgre.github.io/blob/master/articals/img/wifi_tx_a.png?raw=true"
                        alt="wifi_tx_a"/></p>
                <p>At a quick glance we can get an idea that some outputs have higher power than others and it takes a
                    bit
                    more examination to try and understand the differences between outputs or units but it's not very
                    clear;
                    We also can not see if the results pass or fail.</p>
                <p>By modifying how the chart plots to include product ID and adding the limits we can instantly pick
                    out
                    more value from the same data.</p>
                <p><img src="https://github.com/akgre/akgre.github.io/blob/master/articals/img/wifi_tx_b.png?raw=true"
                        alt="wifi_tx_b"/></p>
                <p>Now we are able to see that unit ID_003 fails on both outputs and that output B is higher than output
                    A
                    in nearly all cases. Reporting this to the designer will help them to investigate the causes and
                    improve
                    the design.</p>
                <h2 id="identify-trends-and-outliers">Identify Trends and Outliers</h2>
                <p>In the simple example above a small change makes a big difference and this becomes more important
                    when
                    gathering a multitude of data points.</p>
                <p>If you were to sift through raw data manually, it could take ages to notice patterns, trends or
                    outlying
                    data. But by using data visualization tools like charts, you can sort through a lot of data
                    quickly.</p>
                <h2 id="the-discovery-process">The Discovery Process</h2>
                <p>When discovering your data you don't want your tools slowing you down. This is where I prefer to use
                    data
                    visualisation software like <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> over excel.</p>
                <p>Most reporting tools require your analyst to know exactly what they’re trying to build before they
                    begin,
                    making initial data exploration a slow process of trial and error.</p>
                <p>Tableau’s drag and drop interface allows for anyone to quickly try new ideas, drill into interesting
                    areas and make updates. The ability to rapidly explore and build out visualizations allows for
                    dashboards to provide the most useful and relevant information.</p>
                <h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
                <p>Once the data of interest has been set they can introduced to the report document.</p>
                <p>Tests produce a lot of data that often must be presented to a team so that knowledgeable data driven
                    decisions can be made and fed into the product development lifecycle. To drive consensus among your
                    group, the best way to present data is through reports. Reports can highlight anomalies and help you
                    dig
                    into the details of why a change didn’t perform as expected. Reports can also verify that a change
                    did
                    impact a product positively, such as a performance improvement over the last iteration of a
                    product.</p>
