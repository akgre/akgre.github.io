                        <h2>Test Rig Upgrade For 5G Fixed Wireless Nodes</h2>
                        <p>A large purchase request for a prior product meant the client needed to recommission their
                            production test rig, however, after assembly the test rig did not function as expected. I
                            studied their in-house program to discover that a firmware update of a test instrument was
                            incompatible with their custom control module.
                        </p>
                        <p>I rewrote all their instrument control modules to make them more robust and be able to handle
                            atypical events. I also redesigned the method for controlling a positioning motor which
                            waived the need for human interaction during the test. This allowed them to test units on
                            the production line which otherwise they were not able to do.</p>

                        <h2>Wi-Fi And Bluetooth Testing</h2>
                        <p>The client gave an extremely tight deadline to achieve their targets
                            and meet the schedule of test certification. Previously, more than 150k data points from
                            their tests results were manually organised and processed; Taking an unreasonable period and
                            unnecessarily occupying the time of the technical personnel.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion was a concept created to not only automate data collection but also process
                            the result and present these in a report which would also clearly show anomalies, errors,
                            missing data and data statistics; The data report is available in less than a minute,
                            equally, any revisions or updates are concluded almost instantly – saving months of
                            engineering time for the client’s core technology.

                            <p>The automated data collection method also
                                showed there were discrepancies due to the testing facilities and, as an example, I
                                introduced a Wi-Fi test which demonstrated the deficiencies of the RF loss due to
                                wiring.</p>

                        <h2>RF Performance For Magnetic Induction Communication</h2>
                        <p>A new revision of this client’s chip design was
                            being tested before entering production. Following restructuring within the organisation it
                            became necessary to change the testing and implement new testing procedures.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>The original tests were limited in documentation
                            and had no clear instructions of how the scripts should run. This wasn’t compatible with the
                            development of the product.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>By reverse engineering the tests it was revealed
                            that latest chip revision performed worse than the predecessor. After implementing further
                            testing to investigate relevant tuning parameters I was able to discover values that
                            optimised
                            the performance above the previous design. These new values are now used by the client as
                            the
                            default settings for their production.</p>

                        <h2>DVB Demodulation Performance Of SoC</h2>
                        <p>In this case, the Algorithm Design Engineers
                            were improving the performance of DVB demodulation on their product platform in order to
                            outperform the competition. They were in need of additional testing capabilities for the new
                            standard and to significantly reduce the duration of the tests.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>I implemented the test for the DVB-S2X
                            standard, modernised the test search algorithms and control methods with a surprising
                            threefold increase in productivity. Additionally, I was able to carry out test procedures in
                            parallel by calibrating broadcasting equipment and also increasing testing output, which
                            effectively saved investments which would otherwise have proved impossible to provide.</p>
